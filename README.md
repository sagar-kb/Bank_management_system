Overview
The Banking Management System is a Java-based application that simulates banking operations. The system allows users to register and log in to create and manage bank accounts, perform financial transactions such as debiting, crediting, balance inquiries, and money transfers between accounts. The project is implemented using Java and MySQL, utilizing JDBC for database operations.

Database Setup
Create a MySQL database named banking_system:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE banking_system;
Create the User table to store user registration information:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE User (

    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(100)
);
Create the Accounts table to store bank account information:

CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    account_number BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    balance DOUBLE,
    security_pin VARCHAR(4)
);
How to Run
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Import the project into your IDE.

Set up the MySQL database using the instructions provided above.

java
Copy code
private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_system";
private static final String username = "root";
